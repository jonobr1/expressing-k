# Contemplation 3

## Introduction

For many painters including Kandinsky, the point represents the atomic unit of visual expression. In _Point and Line to Plane_ Kandinsky outlines the origins of the point: a geometric classification and in the written word as a period. By placing a period in different and especially illogical places in a sentence he attempts to reveal an inner voice for the point.

This contemplation doesn't have any interaction, but demonstrates Kandinsky's argument in a timed-based way.^[Kandinsky, Wassily. _Point and Line to Plane_. Kindle Edition. New York: Dover Publications Inc., 1926.] From here, Kandinsky argues that by pushing the point farther away from understood constructs like the written sentence, the point's own inner voice can be witnessed. For this reason and perhaps unlike computational environments, the point can be viewed up close or composed of other points. Painting in particular adds an unexpected element of variation once the brush, pen, or other tool hits the canvas.

A point made of many other points, 128 other points to be precise.
