Understanding Kandinsky's theories, techniques, and practice through bite-sized and interactive explorations known as [contemplations](#the-contemplations).

## Why "Contemplation"?

Kandinsky created or appropriated different nomenclatures to demonstrate the evolution of his thinking in his visual work. His most notable series is the _Compositions_ series. These ten paintings, of which the first three have been lost, are regarded by the painter as his primary artistic declarations.^[See [Wassily Kandinsky Foundation](https://www.wassilykandinsky.net/compositions.php)] He also had _Sketches_, _Improvisations_, and _Movements_ series to explore different aspects of his overall interest in uncovering a pure form of painting. Here's a carousel of the conserved _Compositions_:

I've selected _Contemplations_ as an external series title for these explorations because of its definition:
> __contemplation__ (noun): the action of looking thoughtfully at something for a long time.^[See [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.google.com/search?q=contemplation+define&oq=contemplation+define&aqs=chrome..69i57.2127j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)]

When I think of the time I've spent sifting through Kandinsky's writing, his work, and other musings on the painter's output I'm moved to a contemplative state. I hope you will find the _Contemplations_ series both reflective, but also informative. Each contemplation will have an introduction of what element I'm trying to codify accompanied with additional material. Then towards the bottom, an interactive sketch will let you explore and play with the codified concept yourself.
