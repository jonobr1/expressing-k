## The Project

__Expressing Kandinsky__ aims to provide a series of bite-sized and interactive explorations known as _contemplations_ on abstract painter Wassily Kandinsky's theories, techniques, and practices. It is a living repository on the social media platform Github. The project is under MIT license, so feel free to use all or any of it for derivative works. Finally, this website is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and all of the interactive examples rely on [Two.js](http://two.js.org/). For any questions, comments, concerns, and typos please file an issue on through [Github Issues](https://github.com/jonobr1/expressing-k/issues).

This project is part of the __New Aesthetics__ course in [Paris College of Art](http://paris.edu/)'s Transdisciplinary New Media program and supports the research of the author's thesis research. For further information on Kandinsky see:

## The Author

Jono is an Emmy award winning graphic designer and computer programmer. He comes from mixed heritage, an American of Filipino and Polish descent. As such Jono pairs distinct subjects to frame his creative process. These combinations range from latin and emojis through typography and animation to lithography and pixel sorting. While pairings vary, there is always a consistent and accessible tenor to the digital and physical objects he produces. This attention to detail allows people to access complex subject matters including positivism, the collision of black holes, and music composition. Jono’s work offers considered respite from the fatigue of the attention economy.

To develop his projects Jono writes custom software. Since his undergraduate studies at UCLA’s Design Media Arts, he has and continues to actively participate in open source communities. He shares his own libraries such as the event driven two-dimensional drawing interface for the web Two.js. Jono also co-authored a tool for increasing developers’ feedback loop known as dat-gui. Finally, he contributes to larger projects like the definitive browser-based 3D graphics framework Three.js. Each of these libraries and many others are freely available and actively maintained to help promote the creative expression of individuals around the world.

Jono’s work has been shown at international festivals including TED, Sundance, Tribeca Film Festival, SIGGRAPH, and the Japan Media Arts Festival. He spoke on The Responsibility in Democratization at San Francisco’s first creative coding conference, the Gray Area Festival, and about The Human Side to Being a Digital Practitioner at OpenVis Conference. His commitment to Visual Music has sparked collaborations with musicians including applications with Lullatone, a performance with Nosaj Thing, and interactive music videos for the Arcade Fire and Matthew Dear. You can currently find him nestled up reading Wassily Kandinsky on Line 4 of the Paris metro for his MFA thesis in New Media.
